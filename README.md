# 👋 Hey, I’m Rachel  

I’m a data analyst who loves making sense of messy problems.  
Over the past few years, I’ve worked across **tech, retail, and consumer products** — from digging through millions of rows of Amazon shopping data, to building marketing dashboards in Paris, to figuring out why TikTok ads were (or weren’t) working.  

What I enjoy most is the mix of **detective work and storytelling**:  
finding the root cause in the numbers, then explaining it in a way that actually drives change.

## 🌟 What I Do  

- 🛠 **Analytics & Problem-Solving** → SQL, Python, R, Tableau, PowerBI  
- 🔍 **Root Cause Detective** → A/B tests, causal inference, predictive modeling  
- 🌍 **Cross-Functional Collaborator** → I’ve worked with engineers, product managers, ops, and marketers across 3 continents

## 📌 A Few Highlights  

- At **Amazon**, I automated reporting that cut hours of manual work and helped launch new stores with real customer insights.  
- At **L’Oréal**, I ran experiments in 10 countries to figure out the most profitable way to give away samples (spoiler: not all “freebies” are equal).  
- At **Estée Lauder**, I used NLP to study thousands of Instagram posts and boosted engagement by **5%**.  
- At **TikTok**, I made self-service analytics tools so non-technical teams could get answers without waiting days.

## 🧪 Projects I’m Proud Of  

- **PitchSense (AgentHack 2025, Top 5%)** → Built a model + front-end to match startup founders with VCs and write personalized outreach emails.  
- **NeuroPolis (UC Davis Hackathon, Top 10%)** → Built ML models to predict disasters and filter misinformation, then visualized results with interactive dashboards.

## 🎓 A Bit About My Journey  

- 📊 Master’s in **Business Analytics** @ UC Davis  
- 🌎 Master’s in **International Economics Policy** @ Columbia  
- 📈 Bachelor’s in **International Economics** from Beijing

## 💡 Outside of Work  

I geek out about:  
- Building little automation scripts that save people headaches  
- Exploring how AI can actually help with day-to-day ops (not just buzzwords)  
- Good data visualizations (bonus points if they tell a story)

✨ *At the end of the day, I just like turning messy data into something clear, useful, and maybe even a little bit fun.*
