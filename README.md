## 👩🏻‍💻 About Me

I'm passionate about solving real-world problems with data. My experience spans across global companies like **TikTok**, **L’Oréal**, **Estée Lauder**, and **Amazon Whole Foods** (incoming), where I've worked on projects from pricing strategy and A/B testing to GPT-powered client prediction models.

I enjoy working across both technical and business teams—translating complex analytics into clear, strategic action. Whether it’s a dashboard, a machine learning model, or a quick automation script, I care most about whether it makes someone's job easier or a decision smarter.
