# 👋 Hey, I’m Rachel  

I’m a **data analyst who loves making sense of messy problems**.  
Over the past few years, I’ve worked across **tech, retail, and consumer products** — from digging through millions of rows of Amazon shopping data 🛒, to building marketing dashboards in Paris 🇫🇷, to figuring out why TikTok ads were (or weren’t) working 📱.  

What I enjoy most is the mix of **detective work 🕵️ and storytelling ✍️**:  
finding the root cause in the numbers, then explaining it in a way that actually drives change.

✨ *At the end of the day, I just like turning messy data into something clear, useful, and maybe even a little fun.*
